      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 7,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the implementation of performance optimizations for the Chain of Experts application into detailed subtasks. For each optimization area (caching, request batching, parallel processing, context optimization, rate limiting, benchmarking, and Langfuse instrumentation), create specific implementation steps with clear deliverables and acceptance criteria.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves multiple complex technical areas including caching systems, request batching, parallel processing, and performance optimization. Each area requires specialized knowledge and careful implementation. The task already outlines 7 major components that can be naturally divided into subtasks, each with its own implementation and testing requirements."

      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the process of removing Azure infrastructure code and consolidating AWS deployment into specific subtasks. Include steps for identifying and removing Azure components, updating CI/CD workflows, refactoring configuration management, updating documentation, and optimizing AWS infrastructure with clear deliverables for each subtask.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves infrastructure code removal and consolidation, which requires careful planning to avoid breaking existing functionality. The complexity comes from ensuring all Azure references are removed while maintaining system integrity. The task naturally divides into the identification/removal phase, CI/CD updates, configuration management changes, documentation updates, and AWS optimization."

      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the implementation of multi-provider LLM support into detailed subtasks. Include the creation of the abstraction layer, implementation of provider-specific adapters, configuration system updates, expert refactoring, Langfuse instrumentation enhancements, and documentation updates. For each subtask, specify clear deliverables and acceptance criteria.",
      "reasoning": "This task requires designing and implementing an abstraction layer for multiple LLM providers, which involves complex interface design, provider-specific adaptations, and ensuring backward compatibility. The task touches multiple system components including configuration, existing experts, and monitoring systems. The 6 main components outlined in the details provide a natural division for subtasks."

      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 8,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the implementation of the Expert Management system into detailed subtasks covering both frontend and backend components. Include subtasks for the expert dashboard UI, expert creation form, edit functionality, delete functionality, expert chain visualization, backend API endpoints, database schema updates, and integration with existing systems. For each subtask, specify clear deliverables and acceptance criteria.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves full-stack development with both complex UI components and backend services. It requires creating a complete CRUD system with proper validation, error handling, and integration with existing components. The task spans frontend design, backend API development, database schema changes, and system integration, making it highly complex and suitable for division into multiple subtasks."
