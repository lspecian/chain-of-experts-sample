      "expansionPrompt": "Break down Task #27 into 6 subtasks that cover: 1) Expert management UI dashboard and list view, 2) Expert creation/edit form components with validation, 3) Expert visualization components, 4) Backend API endpoints for expert CRUD operations, 5) Expert registry and runtime management implementation, and 6) Integration with existing systems including database schema updates and documentation. For each subtask, include specific acceptance criteria and testing requirements.",
      "reasoning": "This task has high complexity (8/10) due to its full-stack nature requiring both frontend and backend development with multiple components. It involves UI design, form validation, API development, database schema changes, and integration with existing systems. The task requires careful consideration of runtime behavior, backward compatibility, and proper error handling. The comprehensive testing strategy indicates significant complexity across unit, integration, and end-to-end testing. Six subtasks are recommended to separate frontend components, backend implementation, and integration concerns while keeping each subtask manageable."
