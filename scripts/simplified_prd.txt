Deploying and Monitoring Scalable "Chain of Experts" LLM Applications Across Multi-Cloud Environments with Terraform and Langfuse

Project Overview:
Create a TypeScript application that implements a "Chain of Experts" (CoE) pattern for LLM applications, with deployment infrastructure using Terraform for multi-cloud environments (AWS, Azure, GCP) and observability using Langfuse.

Key Requirements:

1. TypeScript Application
- Implement a Chain of Experts pattern where multiple specialized LLM components work sequentially
- Create a modular architecture that allows for easy addition/replacement of expert components
- Implement proper error handling and context passing between experts
- Support both containerized and serverless deployment options

2. Multi-Cloud Terraform Infrastructure
- Create a well-organized Terraform project structure with modules, environments, and provider configurations
- Implement infrastructure for AWS (ECS/Fargate), Azure (App Service for Containers), and GCP (Cloud Run)
- Set up networking, container registries, compute resources, and load balancing
- Implement remote state management and secure secrets handling
- Create a Dockerfile for containerizing the TypeScript application

3. Langfuse Observability Integration
- Integrate the Langfuse TypeScript SDK for tracing and monitoring
- Implement proper instrumentation for each expert in the chain
- Capture inputs, outputs, metadata, and performance metrics
- Set up evaluation mechanisms using Langfuse's scoring system
- Ensure compatibility with OpenTelemetry standards

4. Documentation and Examples
- Provide comprehensive documentation for the architecture and implementation
- Include examples of adding new experts to the chain
- Document deployment processes for each cloud provider
- Create dashboards and monitoring examples in Langfuse

The solution should be scalable, maintainable, and follow best practices for TypeScript, Terraform, and LLM application development.
